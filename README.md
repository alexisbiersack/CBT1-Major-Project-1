## The Design Process:

I wanted to create a simple, minimal, and modern look for my website. Trying to be minimalist while looking elegant has always been my goal. My first workframe for my portfolio page was this:
<br>
<br>
![Previous](images/initial.png "Initial Framework")
<br>
<br>
I successfully integrated my initial design into a working HTML page but afterwards, I had to change the whole layout. My website now looks like this:
<br>
<br>

![Now](images/now.png "After")
<br>
<br>
I added a lot of elements to my page - skills progress bar, contact form, and a footer. I also placed a bigger profile image. All photos are mine. My name logo was created using Photoshop (using a free logo font). 
<br>
<br>
I will still add other elements to my website, including a portfolio. This website will be updated every now and then.
